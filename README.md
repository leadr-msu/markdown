# Markdown Tutorial

##Headings
To make headings, start the line with a hash #. The more #, the smaller the header.

For Example:
#Header
One # 
##Header
Two ##
###Header
Three ###
####Header
Four ####

##Emphasis
To create bold text, wrap text with two astericks (**) or two underscores (__) on each side. 

To creat italic text, wrap text with one asterick (*) or two underscores (__) on each side. 

##Links
Links can either be inline with the text, or placed at the bottom of the text as references. Link text is enclosed by square brackets [], and for inline links, the link URL is inclosed by the parens ().

[ text ] *no space - delete this part* (webaddress)

##Images
Images are almost identical to links, but an image starts with and exclamation point (!)

!*nospace- delete*[text]*nospace- delete*(leadr.png)

##Blockquotes
To creat a blockquote, start a line with a greater than > followed by an optional space. 

Blockquotes can also be nested using multiple greater than signs and can contain other formating

>First Line - one > sign
>>Second Line - two > signs
>>>Third Line - three > signs

##Lists
Unordered lists can use either astericks (*), plus (+) or hypens (-) as list markers followed by a space before the text. 

* Astericks
+ Plus sign
- Hypens

Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period.

1. Number 1
2. Number 2

##Nested Lists
To nest one list within another, indent each item in the sublist by four spaces. You can also nest other elements like paragraphs, blockquotes or code blocks.
* Item
    1. First Subitem
    2. Second Subitem
* Item
    - Subitem
    - Subitem
* Item
