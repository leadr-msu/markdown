# Markdown Tutorial

##Headings
To make headings, start the line with a hash #. The more #, the smaller the header.

For Example:
#Header
One # 
##Header
Two ##
###Header
Three ###
####Header
Four ####

##Emphasis
To create bold text, wrap text with two astericks (**) or two underscores (__) on each side. 

To creat italic text, wrap text with one asterick (*) or two underscores (__) on each side. 

##Links
Links can either be inline with the text, or placed at the bottom of the text as references. Link text is enclosed by square brackets [], and for inline links, the link URL is inclosed by the parens ().

[ text ] *no space - delete this part* (webaddress)

##Images
Images are almost identical to links, but an image starts with and exclamation point (!)
!*nospace- delete*[text]*nospace- delete*(leadr.png)
